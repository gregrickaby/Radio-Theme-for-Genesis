 /*
    File Name: custom.css
    Description: Use this stylesheet to fine-tune the Radio child theme. Using this stylesheet
    will prevent your customizations from disappearing after a theme update.
	
    BASIC USAGE:
    
    If you have enabled the custom stylesheet in the Genesis options panel, the HTML <body>
    tag will be appended with the "custom" class, like so: <body class="custom">. Because
    custom.css is the last stylesheet to load, you can use the 'custom' class to override 
    any CSS declarations contained in the parent style.css file.
    
    For example, to change the default link color to blue, add the following declarations
    to this file:
	
        .custom a { color: #0000FF; }
